# triadic-approximation-for-contagions-on-higher-order-networks

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/xxx.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/xxx)

'tri_approx.jl' allows to reproduce all the mean-field results.

'aux.jl' contains the code to Montecarlo simulations.

'real_nets.jl' includes the code to generate hypergraphs from real-world datare and to produce the plots for those hypergraphs.

The edges of the original real-world temporal networks and the edges (2-edge and 3-edges) of the generated hypergraphs are provided in '/real_nets'.
