'tri_approx.jl' allows to reproduce all the mean-field results and the plots for random regular hypergraphs.

'aux.jl' contains the code to run Montecarlo simulations.

'real_nets.jl' includes the code to generate hypergraphs from real-world data and to produce the plots for those hypergraphs. The edges of the original real-world temporal networks and the edges (2-edge and 3-edges) of the generated hypergraphs are provided in '/real_nets'.
